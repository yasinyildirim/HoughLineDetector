# Hough line detection

Detects lines in Hough space with Gausian Mixture Models.  

## 1. Introduction

It is written as an alternative to openCV's (3.1.0 so far) HoughLines() method, 
which has problems in calculating local maxima (in nonmaximum suppresion) in the Hough space.

## 2. Dependencies

 - OpenCV 
 - c++ compiler
